    "description": "ReqText is a text based requirements management tool. It is a git native tool that allows you to manage your requirements, tests and progress in a json data format. It is designed to use git version control for requirement changes and history. \n\nThe json will drive a markdown file that will be used to display the requirements in a readable format. \n\nThe CLI shows the requirements in a tree format. \n\nThe requirements are stored in a flat json structure, no nested objects. Allowing for readability and faster parsing.",
